# 3D Printable Articulated Locking "Magic Arm"
An unpowered mechanical arm with three joints of articulation that can be
locked in place with a single knob/lever in the center joint, allowing easy
repositioning of whatever is mounted at the end of the arm. This concept is
commercially available in several different markets, with different attachment
at the end of the arm tailored to those markets. Metalworking machinists
buy them as indicator holders, photographers buy larger versions to hold
photography equipment. These things are sometimes sold with the name "Magic
Arm" though it is not the only use of that name.

Built from metal and machined to to high precision, they can hold position
with a great deal of accuracy. But that also makes them expensive. What if we
want the convenience but don't need to pay for accuracy? We can 3D print our
own less expensive versions out of plastic.

This repository contains my exploration into a 3D-printed articulated arm
using CadQuery (http://cadquery.readthedocs.io/) as my 3D design tool.
